# Python Airbnb Project Review

This project is designed to help review key concepts in Python that will be covered in the Airbnb project of the Higher Level curriculum. The project covers a wide range of topics, including imports, exceptions, classes, private attributes, getters/setters, class methods, static methods, inheritance, unit testing, file I/O, `*args` and `**kwargs`, serialization/deserialization, and JSON handling.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on creating a modular and well-structured codebase that simulates a system for managing geometric shapes. The project includes three main classes: `Base`, `Rectangle`, and `Square`. Each class builds upon the concepts learned throughout the curriculum.

The project provides opportunities to practice the following:

- Implementing classes with private attributes, getters, and setters.
- Handling inheritance to create specialized classes.
- Overriding methods such as `__init__`, `__str__`, and more.
- Writing unit tests to ensure code correctness.
- Dealing with exceptions and validation of input data.
- Implementing class methods and static methods.
- Reading and writing data to files.
- Using `*args` and `**kwargs` for flexible argument handling.


## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and directories:

- `models/`: A package containing the main classes and their related methods.
  - `base.py`: Contains the `Base` class with basic attributes and methods.
  - `rectangle.py`: Defines the `Rectangle` class, inheriting from `Base`.
  - `square.py`: Defines the `Square` class, inheriting from `Rectangle`.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
